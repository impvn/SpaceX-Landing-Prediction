# SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction

## Introduction

Can we predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings? This capstone project dives into forecasting whether the iconic first stage will safely return to Earth after a rocket launch. With each Falcon 9 launch priced at $62 million—far less than competitors due to reusable technology—accurate predictions can impact launch economics and competitive bidding strategies.
